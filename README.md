"LIS at SimpleText 2025: Enhancing Scientific Text Accessibility with LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation"

This paper presents a scientific text simplification system that leverages MedSimplify, a biomedical glossary also introduced in the paper. It was submitted to SimpleText https://simpletext-project.com/2025/, a track that is part of the CLEF 2025 https://clef2025.clef-initiative.eu/ conference.


## 📦 Dataset Description
The MedSimplify corpus is provided as a CSV file containing two columns:

word: The biomedical term
definition: A plain-English explanation of the term

## 🔍 Examples
BMI : a measure of body fat based on height and weight  
ECG : a recording of the heartbeat that helps doctors check if the heart is beating properly. It is made by placing electrodes on the chest, arms, and legs, and connecting them to a machine that records the heartbeat. Getting an ECG doesn’t hurt.
